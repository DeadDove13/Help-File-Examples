https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ The help file for gitHub -good
    The hello world page for github is more of an over view of the web opose a in depth help file, 
    which is good as the page is easy to navigate and use due to its well thought out design making the need of a 
    super indepth help file almost non existant.

https://adblockplus.org/faq The help file for adBlockPlus -good
    the page consists of an index of links corresponding to the most common problems 
    likely experienced by users and/or the creators of the app.

https://support.steampowered.com/ The support page for Steam. -ok but mostly bad
    Again with the steam support page we see a index of links corosponding to the most commin issues with the software.
    However is the case of steam, the software is far more indepth that adblockplus 
    and having a simplifyed help page maybe issue to it's users.
    In my own experience the page does not tend to give you the correct answer when trying to fix and diagnose a problem.

https://support.office.com/ The cupport page for microsoft office software. -anoying
    The page has been simplified to the point where it is just annoying and time consuming to use. 
    I would like to see a better way of arranging the assorted help files/pages.
    However this format will likley work well for simple more commin problems asthe soltion will
    be easy to find.
    
http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_users_guide/c64-users_guide.htm -very good
    The manual for the commodore 64 is an excellent example of a well thought out, non patronising help text. 
    Not only does it teach you how to use the hardware but also explains 
    how to write basic software and fix the hardware should anything go wrong.
